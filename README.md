## Hi there 👋 I'm Pooja Gogoi

#### About Me 

I’m a data analytics enthusiast with a strong interest in turning raw information into meaningful insights. I enjoy working with Python and SQL to analyze patterns, test ideas, and support data-driven decisions. I’m continuously improving my analytical skills by building real-world projects, learning new techniques, and exploring ways to make data more understandable and useful.
